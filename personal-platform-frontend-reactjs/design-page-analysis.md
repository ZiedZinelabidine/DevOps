### Page Structure

The Design page currently consists of the following sections:

2. **Tools Section** - Grid display of design tools used by experts (Figma, Sketch, InVision, etc.)
3. **Projects Section** - Recent web redesign and mobile application projects

### Content

- **Tools Section**: 12 design tools with icons, descriptions, number of freelancers, and hourly rates

### Functionality
